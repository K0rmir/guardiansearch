- #### Advanced

Advanced search gives you the option to refine your search. In the search bar at the top you will see 4 fields and a search button.

  - Keyword - Same as basic search. Enter your search term or phrase here. *This field IS required*.
  - Year - If desired, enter a year here. This fields must be year only. Date formats such as 01/06/202, 01.06.2020 etc will not work. This field is NOT required.
  - Category - If desired, select a category from the dropdown list. This field is NOT required.
  - Search Article Content - If desired, toggle to return articles which *contain* your keyword or phrase in the body of the article content. This field is NOT required. NOTE: By default, this option is toggled off; both basic and advanced search will always return results where the search term or phrase is contained within the headline of the article unless this is toggled.

## Bookmarks 

- #### Any article from either a basic or advanced search can be bookmarked by clicking the icon in the 'Bookmark' column. Bookmarked articles will display a filled icon, where non-bookmarked articles will display an empty icon.
- #### To access your bookmarked articles, click the bookmarks button in the top right-hand corner.

NOTE: In order to bookmark articles, access bookmarked articles and use bookmark actions, users need to be signed in. Guardian Search utilizes [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for user management.

## Bookmark Actions

#### Article results tables across basic search, advanced search and bookmarks are identical save for a one column difference in bookmarks; the 'Actions' column. There are three different option to be performed on any one article. Hovering over each action will inform you of its function.
  
   - Cite Article - Selecting this action will render a new modal with three options on the left-hand side. Each option changes the style of citation that will be generated for the article. 
   - Copy Article URL to Clipboard - Selecting this option will copy the URL of the article straight to your clipboard for easy article sharing.
   - Remove Article - Selecting this action will delete the article from your bookmarks.
